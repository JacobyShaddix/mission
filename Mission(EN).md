#The core principle present in all the roles below:

**Maximizing sustainable happiness throughout life and avoiding suffering**

In a general sense, this means developing the character, habits, and skills that lead to actions aimed at long-term improvement of one’s well-being. If we imagine well-being as the product of time and the amount of happiness at each point in time — **T (Time) * H (Happiness) = TH** — then it becomes clear that the goal is to increase both the length of life and the happiness felt at each moment.

It also follows that any relatively short-term effort aimed at increasing future happiness (even slightly) is a priority, even if it temporarily lowers happiness in the moment. Usually, such effort is about gaining something that will serve you for a long time. Examples of increasing future happiness include building relationships with close ones, gaining knowledge/skills, resolving material or non-material debts, or simply not worrying about unlikely or low-impact problems (e.g., not obsessing over whether the door was locked; or a potential car theft when it’s not in a guarded parking spot). At the same time, it is important to balance **present happiness (Hn)** against **future happiness (Hf)** — if you always sacrifice present happiness for the future, uncertainty in T can lead to a worse overall TH.

##Roles:
**Self**

**Inner Voice**

*The Judge* - its fairness and objectivity ensure that the mission becomes real action. Its role in all situations is to evaluate actions and events in accordance with this mission, preventing impulses and temptations from breaking the plan and principles.

**Body**

*Health*

Health is one of the main factors influencing my lifetime happiness, so I actively take care of it. I undergo preventive checkups, treat acute illnesses, and prevent chronic ones. I maintain a lifestyle (nutrition, exercise) that supports my current health and protects my future well-being. A major priority is to reduce the decline in quality of life with age. Since I have a sedentary lifestyle, I want to add more physically active hobbies, bringing healthy movement into my life. I also take care to make my sitting time less harmful (proper posture, stretching breaks).

*Beauty*

I don’t see beauty as a defining quality of a person, but I also don’t underestimate its impact. I take care of my physical condition and skin. An athletic physique is not a goal, but if I have spare time, I dedicate some of it to getting closer to it.

**Buddhist**

*Foundations*

After learning about Buddhism, I discovered the problems in the straightforward approach to maximizing TH that most people — including myself — naturally follow. That approach is built on chasing pleasure and avoiding discomfort.The issue is that moments of pleasure are extremely short compared to the long periods spent chasing them, and the chase is filled with feelings of incompleteness (from lacking things you believe would complete/make you happy), fear of losing the things that currently bring happiness, and fear of experiencing suffering. Modern science also shows that the fleeting nature of happiness is a biological adaptation that drives survival and reproduction — not personal well-being. Evolution doesn’t require humans to be happy, only to leave more copies of their DNA. In fact, persistent happiness is maladaptive: happy beings don’t avoid danger, seek food, or raise offspring as actively. So we end up with biological processes optimized for species survival, not individual happiness. As a result, sustained happiness is hard to achieve because we quickly adapt to it and it fades.

From a Buddhist perspective, happiness is not feeling only positive emotions and avoiding negative ones. It is inner perception and harmony regardless of emotions or circumstances. Buddhism suggests separating yourself from thoughts and emotions — observing them without acting on your biological urges to avoid the negative and pursue the positive. A useful analogy is watching a movie: you feel the characters’ joy and sadness, but you welcome the emotions, even the unpleasant ones, because you chose to experience the film. The same applies to life. You cannot apply Buddhism only to negative emotions while freely indulging in positive ones, because positive emotions are tied to the fear and suffering that come with their absence. The goal is to stop painting things black and white, stop depending on external evaluation, and build a stable inner self-sufficiency. Buddhism also teaches compassion for other beings (not only humans) because they too are trapped in the same evolutionary loop and strive for the same goals. Another core idea is the absence of inherent existence: “I”, “he”, “she” are abstractions created for survival, but nothing exists independently — everything is interconnected and constantly changing. Meditation is the method Buddhism offers to experience these truths directly — not just intellectually. It teaches you to observe thoughts and emotions, see impermanence, and separate awareness from mental content.

At first glance, Buddhism seems to contradict the mission of avoiding suffering and maximizing happiness. But I see it as a non-linear alternative path toward the same final goal. The standard path tries to eliminate lows and maximize highs — which is impossible, because highs exist only in contrast to lows, and biological adaptation erases stable plateaus. The Buddhist path aims to flatten the curve: reframing setbacks as normal and reframing positive events as normal too, reducing emotional amplitude and making Hmin and Hmax converge into a stable constant, forming something close to a rectangle in the **TH** diagram. How does this relate to the core principle? I reinterpret the word avoid — instead of physically avoiding situations that cause suffering, I change my perception so that suffering stops being “suffering” and becomes a set of neutral events, like wind that came and went. And maximizing happiness is achieved by cultivating qualities (positivity, compassion, curiosity) that allow me to express my best self across as much of life as possible, including the “black” and the “white” periods.

*Practice*

I understand that I may never reach nirvana or full enlightenment, but even an intermediate point improves my **TH**. This intermediate state means that part of me still uses the linear approach, while another part begins to operate through awareness. My goal is to gradually shift from the old perception to the new through sensory and analytical meditation. In practice, I try to perceive ups and downs as opportunities to train awareness and treat them as lessons. If I fail to do so, I fall back to the old strategy: physically avoiding suffering when needed.

**Personality**

*Self-Development*

I observe people and try to learn from them habits and behaviors that improve my TH. I seek more communication with such people and look for new ones. Books on personal development are another source — I read them, update this mission when needed, and find better ways to implement these principles. I like competing with past versions of myself, as it helps me reflect, stay attentive to my growth, and feel progress. But you steadily raise the bar for yourself, so it is valuable to meet someone who is already excellent at what I’m trying to improve — it raises my bar sharply and shows how to think and act to reach that level. It’s also great to meet people skilled in areas I haven’t worked on; since my baseline there is low, the growth can be long-lasting and engaging.

*Entertainment*

I try to see life as a video game where I control the main character, and my goal as a player is to make the game as interesting as possible. I enrich the game with quests, challenges, relationships, and upgrade my character’s skills to unlock new parts of the world. This perspective adds agency to the movie analogy — I can influence the plot. It helps me detach from emotions and thoughts (just like I’m separate from the game character), perceive difficulties as quests (“How will I solve this? What skills can I test now?”), and look for exciting activities. Another bonus: if a video game stops being interesting, you can simply stop playing. This creates a sense of freedom — I am not trapped by circumstances; I choose to “play” and act as I do.

**Other People**

*General Principles*

The traits in others that most increase my desire to build relationships with them are kindness, sincerity, and reliability. Kindness shows they bring positive experiences into the world. Sincerity shows their kindness is genuine and trustworthy. Reliability shows you can count on them — otherwise words mean little. I believe people spread their inner state to those around them — depressed people spread depression; happy people spread happiness. Talking to people and understanding their experiences is an easy way to learn (learning from others’ mistakes). To multiply “good” states, I need to surround myself with people who have them or who strive for them, and reduce interactions with people whose “bad” states they do not wish to change. This includes:

- Helping people develop “good” states and shed “bad” ones if we interpret them similarly
- Adding new people with “good” states into my life
- Reducing interactions with people with “bad” states who don’t want to improve
- Maintaining and deepening relationships with those who have “good” states

Key to developing “good” states is personal growth: abandoning destructive habits and adopting constructive ones. My ways of helping include:

- Personal example
- Positive feedback
- Sharing knowledge and experience that improved my own “good” states
- Pointing out habits that lead to their suffering and offering replacements
- Adjusting my help to the person’s own effort

My invested effort depends on two factors:

- **Potential** — people differ in inertia and ability to grow, so I adjust my effort to the possible future return (i.e., how much they will spread “good” states)
- **Our Emotional Bank Account (EBA)** — the longer and more positive our history, the more effort I invest

All roles below differ only in the configuration of these two factors.

Regardless of a person’s current state, if we are already interacting, I want to understand them as deeply as possible: their worldview, the reasons behind it, and the experiences that shaped it. If their worldview is more effective for maximizing TH than mine, I integrate it.

I see two types of interaction: **words** and **actions**.

**Words**. I generously share my experience and value when others do the same. If a person is open to learning, I gladly give a lot — it’s a cheap way for me to greatly increase someone else’s TH. I divide conversations into 3 levels:

- Events — talking about what happened
- Views on events — adding personal meaning and emotional interpretation
- Principles and character — the worldview behind those interpretations

The third is the most valuable and I aim to reach it with anyone who is open.

**Actions**. I am more cautious, because actions require effort and can create imbalance. I naturally give more than I take, which creates asymmetric relationships and hidden expectations. People also overestimate what they give and underestimate what they receive, so communication is essential. I match my actions to our **EBA** and communicate clearly to keep growth stable and healthy.

I am extra cautious with people lacking sincerity, kindness, reliability, or potential growth — improving such people may worsen society overall. Helping the right people is my small contribution to increasing total happiness and decreasing suffering. My tendency to over-help and because I’m goal-oriented, I often end up trying to solve problems for people who: a) do not actually want to solve their problem (victim position), b) claim they suffer but put in zero effort. I try to invent solutions, push, motivate — and end up fighting both the problem and the person. This drains me and almost never works. So now I first check sincerity:
— How long have they had the problem?
— What have they tried?
— How much effort did they put in?
If advice I give is ignored or half-heartedly tried, I stop. I provide effort only when a person actively applies advice and requests more guidance while showing real motivation.

**Boyfriend**
*General Principles*

My girlfriend is the person with whom I will spend the most time in life, so her states influence my H more than anyone else’s. I want to be someone she can share any thoughts with — good, bad, uncomfortable — without hesitation. I strive to understand her more than anyone else, absorb her worldview, and align with her, because similarity improves shared time. I respect that some of her views may differ from mine, and I see healthy relationships as equal, where both partners are strong, independent individuals.

I consider asymmetric relationships unviable: they create monopoly, suppress potential, and remove diversity. I share my happiness with her wherever possible and want to be part of her happiness. In difficult moments, I aim to make decisions together and consider the needs of both sides.

Overall, I apply the same principles to her as to myself, adapting them to her specifics in order to maximize her TH (which is a core goal). When both partners have high TH, a synergy appears: 1 + 1 = 3.

I also monitor imbalance — giving too much or getting too little leads to lose–win dynamics and eventually hurts both. I speak openly when imbalance appears to restore it.

A key rule is valuing one’s own happiness and communicating desires and expectations even if they might upset the partner. This creates openness, shared responsibility for the relationship, and removes the harmful social script of the man as someone who must sacrifice, suppress emotions, and avoid vulnerability.

**Son**

My parents invested more in me than anyone else, shaped my personality, and give unconditional love and support. I value this and try to return the same — helping them when I can and giving them new experiences and emotions.

I strengthen our relationship and replenish our EBA through communication, shared positive moments, and support. I care about their health to prolong the quality and length of our shared time. I acknowledge my irritability and try to be more patient when expectations don’t match, keeping love and compassion even during misunderstandings.

**Friend**

It is harder for me to classify who is a “friend” or not — to me, friendship is not binary but a continuous scale (like temperature), defined by interaction depth, **EBA**, kindness, sincerity, and reliability.

Because my happiness depends on the number of deep social connections (and only a small percentage reach that depth), I consciously expand my circle of friends, adding sincere and kind people and investing in growth.

My default stance with new friends is maximum openness, readiness to deepen the relationship, and observing their receptiveness. If there are no limiting factors, there is no ceiling to this process.

**Professional**

Since I try to expand my friend circle, colleagues — with whom I spend lots of time — are natural candidates. Professionally, my first priority is my growth; second is maximizing final results and productivity. Both must be achieved without harming other aspects of life (relationships, morale, work-life balance).

Professional growth is first because any job is temporary, and what truly remains is experience (and perhaps a few lasting friendships). Growth benefits both current and future employers and colleagues.

Prioritizing efficiency matters because completing the same task with fewer resources (time, cost, quality tradeoff) gives more experience and skill. Work is full of highly skilled people from whom I can learn, as well as people from diverse fields, which broadens my horizons. As in life, I share my professional experience openly.

**Citizen**

I don’t see myself as a patriot of a country but evaluate myself through the lens of the surrounding community. My test is: If society consisted entirely of people like me, acting as I do, would it thrive or stagnate? This guides me to avoid harmful actions and contribute where I can — as long as it does not significantly reduce my TH.

**Stranger**

I am generally kind to strangers, but given that I know nothing about them, have no EBA with them, tend to give more than I receive, and that many people exploit kindness, I offer help up to the point where it does not pose potential harm to me.

**Resident of Planet Earth**

I love nature, so I try to move toward harmonious coexistence with it and participate in ecological initiatives within my ability to help address global environmental issues.
