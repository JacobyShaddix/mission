# The main principle implemented in all the listed roles:

**Maximization of *sustainable* happiness throughout life and avoidance of unhappiness**

In a general sense, this implies developing a character, habits, and skills that support actions aimed at long-term improvement of one’s well-being. If we roughly imagine well-being as the product of time and your happiness at that moment — **T(Time) * H(Happiness) = TH**, then it becomes clear that this is achieved by increasing the lifespan and happiness at each specific moment. From this it also follows that any relatively short task aimed at improving happiness (even slightly) is a priority, even if it reduces happiness at the moment of doing the task itself. Usually such work involves obtaining something that will serve you for a long time. Speaking about increasing future happiness, this includes building relationships with loved ones, acquiring knowledge/skills, closing material and immaterial debts, or avoiding worries about unlikely or not very painful problems, where we pay later for not worrying, but overall less than if we worried constantly (unlocked doors when leaving; a car stolen when not parked properly, etc.). At the same time, it is necessary to monitor the balance between **present happiness (Hn – Happiness now)** and **future happiness (Hf – Happiness in the future)**, understanding that if you sacrifice present happiness all the time for the sake of future happiness, given the uncertainty of T, you may end up with a lower final result.

## Roles:

**Self**

**Inner voice**

*Judge* — whose fairness and objectivity ensure the implementation of the mission. His role in all situations is to evaluate actions and events in alignment with this mission. Not to let instant desires and temptations deviate from the outlined plan and principles.

**Body**

*Health*

Health is one of the main factors that most influences my happiness throughout life, so I actively monitor my health. I undergo preventive examinations, actively treat acute and prevent chronic diseases. I lead a lifestyle (nutrition, exercise) that supports current and preserves future health. An important priority is taking measures that will help slow the decline in quality of life closer to older age. Having a sedentary lifestyle, I want to add more active types of leisure to my life, trying to find hobbies that will bring more healthy movement into my life. I also ensure that the time I spend sitting is less harmful (proper posture, breaks with stretching).

*Beauty*

I believe that beauty is not a defining quality for a person, but I do not underestimate its significance, and I take care of my physical shape and skin condition. An athletic appearance is not a goal, but if I have extra time, I allocate some of it to get closer to it.

**Buddhist**

*Foundations*

Having become acquainted with Buddhism, I learned about the problems inherent in the straightforward approach to maximizing **TH**, which most people follow, including myself. It lies in the pursuit of everything that brings pleasure and the avoidance of everything unpleasant. The problem is that moments of happiness in such an approach, at the moment of receiving pleasure, are very small compared to the amount of time spent striving for it, and the whole time dedicated to striving for pleasure or avoiding unhappiness is filled with a sense of deficiency (due to the absence of things which, if you had them, would make you complete/happy), fear of losing the things that ensure your happiness, and avoidance and fear of experiencing unhappiness. Supplementing the knowledge gained from Buddhism with recent scientific research, it becomes clear that the fleeting nature of happiness is a biological evolutionary mechanism that stimulates behavior aimed at survival and reproduction. A peculiarity of our evolutionary biological design is that for successful natural selection a human does not need to be happy — they simply need to produce more copies of their DNA. Moreover, from this perspective and the harsh competition on Earth, being happy is harmful, because happy people do not need to hide from dangers, search for food, or raise offspring. As a result, we get a situation where our biological processes are tuned for the success of the species but do not care about the happiness and well-being of an individual. Accordingly, we have initial conditions that hinder achieving sustainable happiness, because a person quickly gets used to it, and it disappears.

From the point of view of Buddhism, happiness is not when you feel positive emotions and do not feel negative ones, but rather the opposite — when you experience perception and harmony inside regardless of your emotions and environment. The answer Buddhism offers is to separate yourself from thought and emotion and learn to perceive them as they are, without trying to do what your nature pushes you to do — avoid negative emotions or pursue positive ones. In some sense, the best example of this is watching a movie — we associate ourselves with the characters, experience negative and positive emotions, but remain open to them and welcome these emotions into our lives (just as we watch a movie knowing it will evoke sadness or fear, but choose to watch it anyway). At the same time, one cannot apply Buddhism only to negative emotions and continue enjoying positive ones, because positive emotions come hand-in-hand with negative emotions related to the absence of positive ones. As a result, the goal is — by stopping painting things black and white — to give up depending on the evaluation of the external world and develop a stable state of self-sufficiency built on one’s inner self. Buddhism also teaches compassion for other beings (not only humans), who have found themselves in the same evolutionary trap as you, and are trying to achieve the same goals as you — therefore, you can help each other reach the same inner balance. Another idea Buddhism proposes is recognizing the absence of things in themselves, that there is nothing that could truly be called “I”, “he”, “she” — these are abstractions created to simplify understanding and survival in the world (good for me, bad for the enemy), but in reality things are derived from the influence of everything else and are not permanent — they are variable and dynamic. This contrasts with the perception of the world as a set of independent units, instead seeing it as a continuous, impermanent, changing, interconnected mass. The method Buddhism suggests for achieving enlightenment (practical understanding and embodiment of all these ideas) is meditation — a practice of sensorial awareness that allows you to separate yourself from thoughts and emotions and observe the impermanence and continuity of the world around you. Essentially, it allows you to experience Buddhist ideas practically rather than analytically so that they become internalized.

At first glance, Buddhism seems to contradict everything stated in this mission regarding avoiding unhappiness and maximizing happiness, but I believe that essentially this is a non-linear/indirect way to achieve the same goal. The difference lies in the fact that the standard path suggests removing dips and maximizing peaks in the graph of your state, which is not realistic even in theory, because peaks can only be peaks relative to dips. If we talk about a plateau of good condition, this cannot be achieved due to biological features of our organism. The Buddhist path offers to level the curve, to perceive failures as something normal, and the same with gifts of fate, thus modulating the curve and making it closer to a straight line. Essentially, measuring happiness as the area under the curve **TH**, and given the flaw of the standard approach where **THmax** (time of pleasure increasing area) is much smaller than **THmin** (time of deficiency decreasing area), we arrive at an answer where **Hmin** is aligned with **Hmax** and becomes a constant, forming something similar to a rectangle. How do we then apply the main principle from the beginning to what is described above? I believe the answer lies in rethinking the meaning of the word **avoid** — instead of physically avoiding people and things that cause unhappiness, I assume a different path that involves changing my perception so that unhappiness stops being unhappiness, and becomes a set of neutral events that happened in my life, like a wind that blew and disappeared. And **maximization of happiness** is achieved by developing skills that allow me to manifest my positive qualities (positivity, compassion for others, curiosity toward the world) across the largest possible portion of life, including conditionally “black” and “white” periods, allowing me to feel happy during that time.

*Practice*

I understand that I may not achieve nirvana and full enlightenment that would maximize the constant value of my happiness, but I believe that even some intermediate point is an achievement and gives me a better **TH**. This intermediate state implies the presence of my old perception, based on the linear approach, as well as the beginnings of a new self-aware behavior. My goal is — through sensory and analytical meditation — to transition from the old to the new perception. In practice, I try to perceive rises and falls as an opportunity to train awareness and accept them as a lesson. If I cannot handle a situation this way, I manage it the old way, which involves physically avoiding suffering.

**Personality**

*Development*

As a personality, I observe the people around me and try to learn from them knowledge, habits, and behaviors that improve my **TH**. To do this, I try to increase communication with people who can provide this and seek new ones. Another source of this knowledge is self-development books; I spend time reading books and updating my mission if necessary, or finding ways to better implement the principles described here. I enjoy competing with my past self in skills and directions — it allows me to look back and better understand myself, requires attentiveness to my present self, and gives me a sense of movement and growth. But the downside is that I raise the bar for myself slowly and gently, so it's great when I find someone skilled in what I am trying to improve — I immediately raise my bar significantly + understand how I need to think and act to get there. It is also great to find impressive people in skills I am not working on, because seeing them makes me realize these are useful skills, and I want to develop them too. A separate benefit is that since it's something I haven't worked on, my skill is likely basic, and the improvement can captivate me for a long time.

*Entertainment*

I try to perceive life as a computer game, where you play the main character, and your goal as a player is to spend the game time as interestingly as possible. I think in terms of enriching my game with exciting quests, competitions, and relationships. For this, you level up the necessary attributes and skills of your character that would open access to new interesting areas of the game. This worldview expands the movie analogy by adding the ability to influence the plot, helps separate yourself from feelings and thoughts (just like I separate myself from the character in a game), perceive difficulties as another quest (shifting thoughts from “when will these difficulties end?” to “I wonder how I will pass them and how I can test my skills?”), and actively seek interesting activities. An additional bonus is that when playing a computer game, you know that if it becomes uninteresting, you can simply stop playing. This understanding gives a sense of freedom — that you are not a victim of circumstances trapped in a cage, but instead constantly make a conscious decision to play this game and act one way or another.

**Other people**

*General principles*

The main character traits I value in others and that increase my desire to strengthen and deepen relationships with them are kindness, sincerity, and reliability. Kindness is needed to understand that these people bring positive experience and spread it to others. Sincerity — to understand that you can trust the truthfulness of their kindness. Reliability — to understand that you can depend on a person, because how can you rely on someone whose actions barely correlate with their words? The main idea that unfolds in my relationships with others is the belief that a person spreads their worldview, mood, and spiritual state to everyone around them (if a person is depressed, they spread it; if happy — they make others happy). And the fact that communicating with people and trying to understand their life experience and motivations is a relatively simple way to gain knowledge and experience (learning from others’ mistakes). Based on this, to multiply “good” states, I need to surround myself with as many people in such states as possible and reduce the number of people with “bad” states. This includes:

- Helping people around me develop “good” states and get rid of “bad” ones if we interpret them similarly  
- Adding new people with “good” states or those aspiring to them into my circle  
- Reducing interactions with people with “bad” states who do not want to get rid of them  
- Maintaining and increasing communication with people with “good” states as much as they are ready for this  
 
The key to developing “good” states is personal development through abandoning views and habits that destructively affect the individual and replacing them with ones that create new opportunities, unlock potential, and increase motivation for constructive behavior. My methods of helping develop “good” states include:

- Personal example.  
- Positive feedback.  
- Sharing knowledge and experience that helped develop my own “good” states.  
- Highlighting views and habits a person is inclined to, which lead to their unhappiness, and giving advice on eliminating and replacing them.  
- Actions whose intensity depends on the person’s own efforts  

The amount of effort I invest depends on two factors:

- **Potential** — by nature, people have different inertia and potential, so I correlate my actions with possible future gains (in dividends of spreading “good” states by this person to others in the future due to my influence).  
- Balance on our **emotional bank account (EBA)** with this person (the longer and more positive our interaction history is, the more effort I invest, and vice versa).  

Essentially, the roles described below will differ only by different levels of these two factors, which determine how much effort I invest in their development.

Regardless of a person’s current state, if I am already interacting with them, I want to understand them as deeply as possible during the time we have. To understand means to hear their worldview, analyze the reasons for such views, and understand the life experience that caused them. If I find these views consistent and more effective than mine in terms of **TH**, I strive to adopt them into my worldview.

I distinguish two primary types of interaction with another person: **words** and **actions**.

In **words**, I generously share my experience, feelings, and skills, and I appreciate receiving the same in return. If I see openness in a person to accept my experience and knowledge, I am ready to provide a large amount of it, as this is a relatively low-cost way for me to bring maximum benefit and increase another person’s **TH**. I conditionally divide communication into 3 levels, each following one expands the previous:

- Talking about events — conversations about the world at a surface level, telling about events and facts in one’s life.  
- Talking about your view of events — expands the previous level, adding your attitude toward events, partially revealing your personality.  
- Talking about principles, character — expands the previous level, adding principles and paradigms that form a person’s worldview, revealing the essence of a person as much as they know themselves.  

Of the three levels, the last one is the most desirable, and I aim to reach it with everyone who is open to it. I am ready to take the first step at each level and reveal myself to create conditions for replenishing our **EBA** and mutual openness. It is the most desirable because:

- it allows you to know and understand the person the most, thus developing your relationship deeper;  
- it provides the most material and knowledge for your own development;  
- it allows both you and the person to open up and feel understood and heard.  

In **actions**, I am more cautious because they require more effort and understanding the ratio of effort to our current **EBA**. I tend to give more than receive, which is a loss because it leads to asymmetric relationships, where sooner or later you begin to consider the other person a debtor, and they may feel guilty — which does not contribute to healthy relationship development. Additionally, people tend to overestimate what they give and underestimate what they receive, so it is important during relationships to align the understanding of what is given and received to avoid false expectations. Therefore, correlating my actions with our current **EBA** and clearly communicating the effort spent and benefits received, I ensure stable and harmonious growth of our **EBA** and relationship.

At the same time, I am more cautious with people who lack sincerity, kindness, reliability, and potential for development (in my subjective view), because I believe that developing such people negatively affects the overall well-being of society. Thus, I make a small contribution to developing and multiplying the general happiness and reducing overall suffering in society, which forms the background affecting everyone.

Due to my determination and focus on solving problems, I often end up in a situation where:  
a) a person, for various reasons, does not want to solve their problems and is satisfied with their current state, even though their words claim they suffer from these problems (victim position);  
b) I, hearing about the person’s suffering and declared lack of solutions, try to come up with solutions for them, write out next steps and action algorithms, help them with motivation, and push them toward resolving the problem when they have abandoned it.

The result is a situation where the person does not want to solve their problem, and I end up fighting not only the problem but also the person to solve it. This heavily drains my resources, creates expectations that this effort will be appreciated later, and that the person — after so many efforts have been made (by us or by me alone) — will start moving toward the solution. But in reality, due to the lack of true desire to change, results rarely come, and even more rarely are they worth my efforts — but they consistently bring suffering to me and probably to the person as well. Knowing this trait of mine, I strive to be very cautious when helping people with their problems if they did not ask for help and have not taken any actions themselves. My first steps should aim not at solving the problem but at understanding the sincerity (including sincerity with oneself) of the person. For this, I first ask how long the problem has existed, what solutions they have thought about, which ones they tried to implement, and what difficulties they faced — this helps me understand how much they genuinely strive for resolution. The next step is to give advice on the solution; if after several pieces of advice I hear vague excuses, I stop. Giving advice, I create no expectations regarding whether the person will implement it, and even more so, I do not take any actions myself. If after some time I hear about the same problem again, I ask about the previous advice; if it was not applied at all or applied halfway without effort — I do not try to give new ones. I do not try to create motivation in the person to solve the problem. I resort to my efforts in helping **only** when the person has accepted the advice, actively tried it, actively asks for more consultations, and shows motivation to continue along this path.

**Boyfriend**

*General provisions*

My girlfriend is the person with whom I will spend the most time in my life, so her states will influence my **H** more than the states of anyone else. For her, I want to be someone with whom she can share any of her thoughts (good, bad, unpleasant) without doubting whether she should. I strive to understand her more than anyone else, listen to her thoughts and views, trying to absorb them, because the more similar we are, the better our time together will be. I acknowledge the existence of views that may contradict mine and respect them, because I believe that the key to a healthy relationship is an equal relationship where both opinions matter, and each person has a strong, independent, and developed personality.

I consider asymmetric relationships to be unpromising, because they create a monopoly, suppress the potential of the other person, and deprive the relationship of diversity. I try to share my happiness with her wherever possible, because it enriches my experiences. I also strive to be part of my partner’s happiness to further strengthen her experiences. In moments of difficulty, I aim to make decisions together and consider everyone’s interests. In her moments of failure, I try to maintain a balance between offering support and helping solve the issues.

Overall, I aim to apply the same principles to my partner as I do to myself, considering the partner’s individual characteristics that may require a slightly different configuration of maximizing her **TH** (which is the final goal of my actions). Ensuring high **TH** for myself and high **TH** for my partner, through the spread of each other’s states, we achieve synergy, resulting in the formula 1+1=3.

Striving to be flexible and meet her halfway, I also ensure that no large imbalance accumulates in the relationship, because I understand that in the long run it leads to lose-win dynamics from my side, which ultimately causes everyone to lose. To prevent this, I speak honestly and directly when I feel that I am giving too much or receiving too little, with the goal of restoring balance or aligning our views on the current balance. It is important to remember that we often give what may not be truly needed by the other, so communication is essential to understand where the misjudgment lies.

For a relationship, it is important to value your own happiness and communicate your desires and expectations to your partner, even when they may upset them. This helps both sides express their positions and search for a shared solution that leaves everyone happy. This approach creates openness and mutual care for the relationship, where each partner is valued. It also allows one not to see themselves as a servant of the relationship or fall into the social role of a “man” who must sacrifice himself for the family, has no right to emotions or vulnerability.

**Son**

Parents are the people who invested the most effort into me and influenced the formation of my personality the most, and are also a source of constant unconditional love and support. I value this and try to repay them by helping in their lives as much as possible and giving them new experiences and emotions. I try to strengthen our relationship and regularly replenish our **EBA** through communication, pleasant shared moments, and support. I take care of their health to extend the duration and quality of our time together. I acknowledge my irritability and aim to be more patient when our expectations do not match, preserving love and compassion in moments where they are challenged by misunderstandings.

**Friend**

Compared to other roles, it is harder for me to clearly define how people enter and leave this circle. For me, this concept is less binary (friend/not friend) and more of a continuous, unlimited scale (like temperature) — its value depends on the level of communication, your **EBA**, kindness, sincerity, and reliability. Since my happiness is influenced by the number of my deep social connections, and a small percentage of overall connections reaches such depth, I intentionally try to expand my circle of friends, adding sincere and kind people, and investing effort into developing these relationships.

Initially, I aim for the deepest possible relationship with each new friend, ready to take the first step both in expanding the circle and deepening the bond, and then observe how the person perceives this and their openness to strengthening the connection. If there are no limiting factors, this process has no boundaries.

**Professional**

Since I aim to expand my circle of friends, and colleagues are people with whom I spend a lot of time, I have many opportunities to understand a person and decide whether I want to move them into the circle of friends. If speaking purely about professional relationships, the first priority is ensuring my professional growth, the second is achieving the maximum final result and maximum productivity. Both goals must be achieved while maintaining all other work and non-work aspects (relationships, morale, work-life balance) in an acceptable or better state.

I prioritize my professional growth because I understand that any job is temporary, and the only lasting thing from it (aside from connections with other people, which usually remain in small quantity and rarely of high quality unless they join the circle of friends) is my professional experience. Moreover, by developing professionally, I benefit current and future companies and colleagues, resulting in a win-win for everyone.

Prioritizing efficiency is due to the fact that performing the same task, you can gain more experience and skills if you use fewer resources (time, quality, or cost), which ultimately affects your professional development. The final result means the product or project you are working on, in both qualitative and quantitative aspects. At work, more often than in other contexts, you encounter more experienced people from whom you can learn to improve your skills. People from various fields also gather here and realize their potential, making it fertile ground for broadening your horizons and discovering new interesting directions. Similarly to life, I am open to sharing my experience and giving back to the professional community.

**Citizen**

I do not consider myself a patriot of my country and evaluate myself more in terms of the surrounding community rather than statehood. The criterion for evaluating myself as a member of society is the following question: if a society consisted entirely of people like me, acting as I do — would this society thrive or stagnate? Thus, I pay significant attention to avoiding actions harmful to society and attempt to do what is within my influence to improve it, as long as this does not come at the cost of my **TH**.

**Random passerby**

Overall, I treat unfamiliar people around me with kindness, but given my zero knowledge of a specific person and the absence of an **EBA**, knowing that I am inclined to give more than I receive, and considering that many people exploit the kindness of others for personal benefit, I am willing to provide reasonable help to anyone — up to the point where it may pose potential harm to me.

**Resident of planet Earth**

I like nature, so I try to move toward harmonious coexistence with it and participate within my abilities in ecological initiatives to solve global environmental issues.
